This project is a parallax website that demonstrates the implementation of a parallax scrolling effect. By developing this project, I have gained valuable experience and learned the following:

1.Utilizing HTML and CSS to create an interactive web page.
2.Implementing the parallax scrolling effect to create a visually engaging user experience.
3.Manipulating CSS properties such as transform, translateZ, and scale to achieve the desired visual effects.
4.Incorporating background images and foreground elements to create depth and visual interest.
5.Applying positioning and styling techniques to create visually appealing sections and text overlays.
